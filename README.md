Client Story :

Our KLN college is filled with enthusiastic engineers who are
brimming with bright new ideas. But there’s a problem. They don’t
seem to know how to build their idea into a prototype. They need
some “Pro” assistance from IIPC’s members . They need a portal,
a simple web Application to post their project ideas and see if they
can get any assistance from the member’s who are available at
IIPC and even get them to guide them all the way through the
project.

Client requirements :

● The portal web application must be a fully functional web
application accessible to everyone via a simple link / url

● Users ( Students or teachers ) must be able to create an
account on the site. The signup will require a valid college ID
and a name and roll no / staff no . There are 2 account types
namely staff and students.

● The student users will have two mains features : view
project proposals and post project proposals

● On login both student and staff will be taken to a home page
with a feed showing all project proposals

● Students will have post project tab and my projects tab

● Each project proposal consists of a title , a description of the
project , a list of components required , a budget for total
completion ( if approved ) , time required , Type of Asset
required ( tech mentor or non-tech mentor ), which when
entered in “post project” tab will create a new project post

mentoring” on clicking it , the staff will be allotted as the
group’s mentor

particular user

this tab

● Each entry in this tab will be a project post, with a indicator
for “waiting for moderator” , “waiting for mentors”, “mentor
allotted”

● Once any project gets a mentor , a new tab called “Chat with
mentor” must appear on both student and staff account

● Using that tab they can chat with each other about project
proceedings

● A Super-user called “admin” should be made available,
which will have all the newly created posts

● This account will ‘moderate” all the posts for unnecessary
content to keep the app community healthy
